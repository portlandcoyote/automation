# TODO 

1) AGOL .csvs by year (from Observation date/Enter a date) One file for each year in dataset + unspecified (e.g., 2022.csv, 2023.csv, Unspecified.csv)
2) For Sheets to ARCGIS: Upload a csv directly to AGOL in bash shell

### COMPLETED

#### 01/10/2024
- [x] Exact copy of raw data included in the output files~
- [x] Add crosscheck to script: master+rejected should equal raw (input version, not copy just in case?)
- [x] Add a column to master for the month number corresponding to the Observation date/Enter a date (03/02/23 
  becomes 3, 07/05/23 becomes 7, etc.)
