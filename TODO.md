# TODO 

1) Different years for agol csv. file tree for each year. Zuriel's description: AGOL .csvs by year (from Observation date/Enter a date) One file for each year in dataset + unspecified (e.g., 2022.csv, 2023.csv, Unspecified.csv)
2) Add crosscheck to script: master+rejected should equal raw (input version, not copy just in case?)
4) Exact copy of raw data included in the output files
5) Add a column to master for the month number corresponding to the Observation date/Enter a date (03/02/23 becomes 3, 07/05/23 becomes 7, etc.)
6) For Sheets to ARCGIS: Upload a csv directly to AGOL in bash shell
